# TuneFlow — Music Streaming Platform

A production-shaped music streaming platform: **Java 21 / Spring Boot 3.5 modular monolith backend**
and a **Flutter + Riverpod client**. Built to the TuneFlow Technical Documentation (v1.0):
modular monolith with clean module boundaries, JWT auth with refresh rotation, Redis caching,
Kafka eventing, S3/MinIO media with short-lived signed URLs, FFmpeg processing, and a
PostgreSQL-backed catalog — packaged so it boots with nothing but a JVM in dev and scales
horizontally in production.

## What is in the box

| Capability | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Email/password auth, JWT access + refresh rotation | ✅ | Replay of a spent refresh token is detected and rejected |
| RBAC (`USER`, `ARTIST`, `ADMIN`) | ✅ | Enforced by role on routes and by ownership in services |
| Catalog: songs, albums, artists, genres | ✅ | Soft delete, UUID v4 PKs, DB-level constraints |
| Playlists (CRUD, add/remove/reorder songs) | ✅ | Ownership checks; foreign resources return 404, not 403 |
| Likes and liked-songs library | ✅ | Duplicate likes rejected with `ALREADY_LIKED` |
| Play history and listening stats | ✅ | Async final-update semantics from the player |
| Streaming with signed short-lived URLs | ✅ | Audio never proxied by application code in production |
| Downloads | ✅ | Size estimate from bitrate, `song.downloaded` event |
| Recommendations | ✅ | Rule-based strategy (genre affinity → trending), deterministic and testable |
| Search + typeahead suggestions | ✅ | PostgreSQL `pg_trgm` fuzzy matching (no Elasticsearch in the MVP) |
| Lyrics with LRC parsing | ✅ | Multi-timestamp hooks, precision variants, sync validation |
| Notifications and new-release fan-out | ✅ | Kafka-driven, in-process by default |
| Rate limiting | ✅ | Bucket per client + route class, `X-RateLimit-*` / `Retry-After` |
| Caching (Caffeine / Redis) | ✅ | Profile-selected, TTL per cache, cache-aside with eviction on writes |
| Kafka eventing | ✅ | `noop` (in-process) or `kafka` publisher behind one interface |
| S3/MinIO + local storage | ✅ | One `StorageService` abstraction, two implementations |
| FFmpeg/FFprobe media pipeline | ✅ | Duration probing + transcode/HLS behind a feature flag |
| Observability | ✅ | Actuator health, Micrometer, Prometheus, cache stats |
| Flutter client | ✅ | Feature-first clean architecture, Riverpod, Dio, persistent mini-player; `flutter analyze` clean and 31/31 tests passing |

Each backend module owns its `dto/`, `entity/`, `repository/`, `service/` and `controller/`
packages. Cross-module calls go through the owning module's service interface, never through
another module's repository — the boundary that makes the later split into services mechanical.

---

## Quick start

### Option 1 — Zero dependencies (H2, fastest)

```bash
cd backend
mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=dev
```

Boots in ~10 s with an in-memory H2 database, Caffeine cache, local disk storage and in-process
event fan-out. Demo data (users, artists, albums, songs, likes, a playlist, history) is seeded.
API at `http://localhost:8080/api/v1`, Swagger UI at `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html`.

### Option 2 — PostgreSQL, everything else in-process

```bash
docker compose up -d postgres
cd backend && mvn spring-boot:run
```

### Option 3 — Full stack

```bash
docker compose up -d postgres redis kafka minio minio-init
cd backend && SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=prod mvn spring-boot:run
# or build the API too:  docker compose --profile app up -d --build
```

| Service | URL | Credentials |
|---|---|---|
| API | http://localhost:8080/api/v1 | — |
| Swagger UI | http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html | dev profile only |
| Health | http://localhost:8080/actuator/health | — |
| Prometheus metrics | http://localhost:8080/actuator/prometheus | — |
| MinIO console | http://localhost:9001 | `minioadmin` / `minioadmin` |
| PostgreSQL | `localhost:5432/tuneflow` | `tuneflow` / `tuneflow` |
| Redis | `localhost:6379` | — |
| Kafka (external listener) | `localhost:29092` | — |

### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
flutter pub get
flutter run --dart-define=API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080/api/v1
```

Android emulator: use `http://10.0.2.2:8080/api/v1`.

---

## Demo accounts

Seeded by the `dev` profile (password for all three: `Password123`):

| Email | Role | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `listener@tuneflow.dev` | USER | Listener with likes, a playlist and play history |
| `artist@tuneflow.dev` | ARTIST | Artist profile "Aria Vance", owns albums and songs |
| `admin@tuneflow.dev` | ADMIN | Full catalog access (no admin UI in this scope) |

Seed data: 10 genres, 2 albums, 6 songs, likes, a follow, the playlist *Late Night Drive* and
play history, so every feed on the home screen is populated on first launch.

---

## Architecture

**Modular monolith** (docs §4–§6): a single deployable with strict internal module boundaries.

```
Controller  →  Service (interface)  →  Repository  →  PostgreSQL
     ↓              ↓
   DTOs         Domain rules, caching, events
```

Rules enforced across the codebase:

- Controllers never touch repositories; they translate HTTP ↔ DTOs and delegate.
- Entities never leave the service layer — responses are built by explicit mappers.
- Cross-module access goes through service interfaces (`ArtistService`, `SongService`, …).
- Flyway owns the schema; Hibernate runs with `ddl-auto: validate`, so a mapping drift fails the
  build at boot instead of silently mutating production tables.
- Errors are translated centrally by `GlobalExceptionHandler` into the error envelope; a module
  throws an `ApiException` with a typed `ErrorCode`.

### Profiles

| Profile | Database | Cache | Events | Storage | Use |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| default | PostgreSQL | Caffeine | in-process | local disk | Local development with Docker Postgres |
| `dev` | H2 (in-memory) | Caffeine | in-process | local disk | Zero-dependency demo, CI |
| `prod` | PostgreSQL | Redis | Kafka | S3/MinIO | Real deployments |
| `test` | H2 (in-memory) | Caffeine | in-process | local disk | Integration tests |

## API surface

Base path `/api/v1`; 60+ operations across 17 controllers (53 documented paths). Every list
endpoint is paginated with `page`/`size` (default size 20, max 100) and returns a consistent
paged payload.

| Group | Representative endpoints |
|---|---|
| Auth | `POST /auth/register`, `POST /auth/login`, `POST /auth/refresh`, `POST /auth/logout`, `POST /auth/logout-all`, `POST /auth/forgot-password`, `POST /auth/reset-password` |
| Users | `GET/PUT/DELETE /users/me`, `PUT /users/me/password`, `GET /users/me/liked-songs` |
| Artists | `GET /artists`, `GET /artists/popular`, `GET /artists/{id}`, `PUT /artists/{id}`, `POST/DELETE /artists/{id}/follow`, `GET /artists/following`, `GET/PUT /artists/me` |
| Albums | `GET /albums`, `GET /albums/new-releases`, `GET /albums/{id}`, `POST/PATCH/DELETE /albums/{id}` |
| Songs | `GET /songs` (filters: `artistId`, `albumId`, `genre`, `q`), `GET /songs/trending`, `GET /songs/new-releases`, `GET /songs/{id}`, `POST/PUT/DELETE /songs/{id}`, `POST/DELETE /songs/{id}/like` |
| Genres | `GET /genres`, `POST /genres`, `PUT/DELETE /genres/{id}` (genre track lists come from `GET /songs?genre=<slug>`) |
| Playlists | `GET /playlists`, `GET /playlists/public`, `POST /playlists`, `GET/PUT/DELETE /playlists/{id}`, `POST /playlists/{id}/songs` (add), `PUT /playlists/{id}/songs` (reorder), `DELETE /playlists/{id}/songs/{songId}`, `DELETE /playlists/{id}/songs` (clear) |
| Streaming | `GET /songs/{id}/stream`, `POST /downloads`, `GET /downloads`, `POST /downloads/{id}/complete`, `DELETE /downloads/{id}` |
| History | `POST /history`, `GET /history/recently-played`, `GET /history/stats`, `DELETE /history` |
| Search | `GET /search`, `GET /search/suggest` |
| Discovery | `GET /home`, `GET /recommendations`, `GET /recommendations/strategy` |
| Lyrics | `GET/PUT /songs/{songId}/lyrics`, `GET /songs/{songId}/lyrics/languages`, `DELETE /songs/{songId}/lyrics/{language}` |
| Notifications | `GET /notifications`, `GET /notifications/unread-count`, `POST /notifications/{id}/read`, `POST /notifications/read-all` |
| Uploads | `POST /uploads/audio`, `POST /uploads/image` |
| Media | `GET /media/{key}` — signed read endpoint |
| Ops | `GET /actuator/health`, `GET /actuator/prometheus` |

Public (no token): catalog reads, search, home, recommendations, genre lists, artist and album
listings, and signed media URLs (the signature *is* the authorisation).
Everything else returns `401 UNAUTHENTICATED` with the standard error envelope.

---

## Response envelope

Success:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Login successful",
  "data": { "accessToken": "…", "refreshToken": "…", "tokenType": "Bearer", "expiresIn": 900 },
  "timestamp": "2026-10-06T09:15:04.221Z"
}
```

Error — HTTP status is meaningful (400/401/403/404/409/429/500), and `errorCode` is the stable
machine-readable key:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Authentication required",
  "errorCode": "UNAUTHENTICATED",
  "path": "/api/v1/users/me",
  "timestamp": "2026-10-06T09:15:04.221Z"
}
```

Validation failures additionally carry `fieldErrors: [{ "field", "message", "rejectedValue" }]`.

Selected error codes: `VALIDATION_FAILED`, `BAD_CREDENTIALS`, `UNAUTHENTICATED`, `FORBIDDEN`,
`TOKEN_EXPIRED`, `INVALID_TOKEN`, `INVALID_REFRESH_TOKEN`, `EMAIL_ALREADY_EXISTS`,
`RESOURCE_NOT_FOUND`, `SONG_NOT_FOUND`, `PLAYLIST_NOT_FOUND`, `ALREADY_LIKED`, `NOT_LIKED`,
`ALREADY_FOLLOWING`, `RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED`, `UNSUPPORTED_MEDIA_TYPE`, `FILE_TOO_LARGE`,
`STORAGE_ERROR`, `INTERNAL_ERROR`.

---

## Authentication

- **Access token** — HS256 JWT, 15 minutes, claims `sub` (user id), `email`, `name`, `role`, `iat`, `exp`.
- **Refresh token** — opaque random value, SHA-256 hashed at rest, 30 days, **rotated on every use**.
  Presenting a token that was already rotated invalidates the family and returns
  `INVALID_REFRESH_TOKEN` — the standard defence against refresh-token theft.
- **Logout** revokes the supplied refresh token.
- **Password reset** — single-use token with a short TTL; the token store is Caffeine in development
  and Redis in production. With `tuneflow.security.expose-reset-token: true` (dev only) the token is
  returned in the response so the flow can be exercised without an SMTP server.
- **Clients must refresh on `401`**, which is why authentication failures return 401 rather than 403:
  the Flutter interceptor can distinguish "get a new token" from "you are not allowed".

---

## Streaming and media

The documentation is explicit: **audio must never be proxied through the application** (§17, §33).
TuneFlow follows that in production and stays testable locally:

1. `GET /songs/{id}/stream` (authenticated) → `{ url, expiresInSeconds, format, bitrateKbps }`.
2. The URL carries an HMAC-SHA256 signature over `key + expires + client`, so a URL cannot be
   shared, extended or edited.
3. In production that URL points at S3/MinIO or the CDN (swap in `TUNEFLOW_CDN_BASE_URL`).
   With the local storage provider it points at `GET /api/v1/media/{key}` — a purpose-built
   byte-range streamer: manual `RandomAccessFile` reads, 64 KB buffer, `Range` honoured with
   `206 Partial Content` + `Content-Range`, `Accept-Ranges: bytes`, 1 MB per-response cap,
   `Cache-Control: private, no-store`.
4. Tampered, foreign or expired signatures return `403`.

The media path is the one place where a hand-written controller beats a framework helper:
returning `ResourceRegion` from a controller with explicit `Content-Length`/`Content-Range`
headers fails at runtime (Spring writes those headers into an unmodifiable map, and a preset
`Content-Type` defeats content negotiation). The manual streamer is deliberate — do not refactor
it back.

---

## Search

MVP search runs entirely on PostgreSQL — no Elasticsearch (§24 allows either, and the MVP does not
need a second stateful service):

- `GET /search?q=&type=all|songs|artists|albums|playlists` with per-type caps and a combined
  `totalResults`.
- Two passes: an exact `ILIKE` match over title/name fields; if that returns nothing, a **tokenized
  fallback** that matches the leading token, so a typo in a trailing word still finds the track
  (`neon skylne` → *Neon Skyline*, reported as `fuzzyMatched: true`).
- `fuzzyMatched` is only true when the fallback actually returned rows — an empty result never
  advertises a fuzzy match.
- The `search` cache is short-lived (5 minutes) so newly uploaded tracks appear quickly.
- `GET /search/suggest?q=` returns lightweight typeahead entries (titles, artists, genres).
- The provider sits behind a `SearchProvider` interface with `tuneflow.search.provider=jpa|elasticsearch`,
  so an Elasticsearch implementation can be dropped in without touching a single controller.

---

## Caching strategy

Cache-aside with explicit invalidation on writes; provider chosen by profile
(`caffeine` or `redis`), and cache statistics are exported to Micrometer.

| Cache | TTL | Invalidated by |
|---|---|---|
| `songs` | 15m | song create/update/delete, like/unlike, play-count updates |
| `albums` | 15m | album create/update/delete |
| `artists` | 30m | artist update, follow/unfollow |
| `search` | 5m | TTL only (short by design) |
| `homeFeed` | 5m | TTL only |
| `recommendations` | 30m | TTL only |
| `genres` | long | genre create |

The subtle one: incrementing a play count must evict the song cache entry, otherwise
`GET /songs/{id}` keeps serving a stale counter. `HistoryServiceImpl.incrementPlayCount` carries
`@CacheEvict(cacheNames = "songs", key = "#songId")` for exactly that reason, verified end to end
(1240 → 1241 within ~2 s of an async history post).

Eviction uses `flushAutomatically` but **not** `clearAutomatically`: clearing the persistence
context detaches entities that are still being mapped into the response and produces
`LazyInitializationException`. This is a known trap in this codebase.

---

## Asynchronous events

One `EventPublisher` interface, two implementations (`noop` in-process, `kafka`), selected by
`tuneflow.events.publisher`. Business code never knows which one is active.

| Event | Emitted when | Consumers |
|---|---|---|
| `song.played` | a playback is recorded | history aggregations |
| `song.completed` | a track finishes | recommendation signals |
| `song.liked` / `song.unliked` | like toggled | taste profile |
| `song.created` | artist uploads a track | new-release notification fan-out |
| `song.downloaded` | a download completes | analytics |
| `playlist.created` / `playlist.updated` | playlist mutations | activity feeds |
| `user.followed` | a listener follows an artist | artist notifications |

Kafka publishing is best-effort and never blocks the HTTP response: the request path performs the
write, then hands the event to the publisher. This keeps the modular monolith honest — the same
events already carry the information a future extracted service would need.

---

## Rate limiting

`RateLimitFilter` (Redis-backed counters when Redis is enabled, in-memory otherwise) applies
per-client buckets by route class:

| Route class | Limit |
|---|---|
| Authentication (`/auth/**`) | 5 requests/minute per IP |
| Uploads (`/uploads/**`) | 10 requests/minute per user |
| Everything else | 100 requests/minute per user (or IP when anonymous) |

Exceeded requests get `429` plus `Retry-After`, `X-RateLimit-Limit`, `X-RateLimit-Remaining`
and `X-RateLimit-Reset`. Development relaxes the auth bucket to 20/minute so manual testing is not
throttled.

---

## Storage and FFmpeg

`StorageService` is the single seam for object storage:

- **`local`** — filesystem under `TUNEFLOW_MEDIA_PATH`, keys are `images|audio/YYYY/MM/{uuid}.{ext}`,
  URLs signed by the application.
- **`s3`** — S3-compatible (AWS S3, MinIO), path-style access for MinIO, presigned URLs for reads.

Uploads are validated before they are stored: extension and content type whitelists, size limits
(100 MB audio, 10 MB images), and non-audio content is rejected outright.

FFmpeg/FFprobe integration provides duration probing and, behind `tuneflow.media.hls-enabled`,
transcoding/HLS packaging. When the binaries are absent the pipeline degrades to metadata-only
processing instead of failing the upload — a developer machine without FFmpeg can still exercise
the whole upload flow.

---

## Observability

- `/actuator/health` with liveness and readiness groups; Redis health is checked only in `prod`
  (dev runs Caffeine, so a missing Redis must not report the app as down).
- `/actuator/prometheus` — HTTP metrics, JVM metrics, connection pool, and cache metrics
  (`cache_gets_total`, `cache_evictions_total`, …) thanks to `.recordStats()` on the cache manager.
- Structured logging with a per-request correlation id echoed back in the response.
- Every error path logs with context (user, route, error code) while the client receives a
  sanitised message — stack traces never leak to API consumers.

---

## Testing

**24 automated tests, all green** (`mvn test`) — no Docker and no external services required.

| Suite | Type | What it covers |
|---|---|---|
| `JwtServiceImplTest` | Unit | Claim round-trip, tampering, expiry reported separately, foreign signing key, fail-fast on a short secret |
| `LrcParserTest` | Unit | Timestamp precisions, repeated hooks, ordering, LRC detection |
| `RuleBasedRecommendationStrategyTest` | Unit | Cold-start fallback, genre affinity, already-liked exclusion, limit |
| `SongServiceLikeTest` | Unit | Like/unlike rules, counter side effects, soft-delete invisibility, artist ownership vs admin override, guest callers |
| `ApiIntegrationTest` | Integration | Full journey on the real Spring context (register → login → browse → search → stream → like → playlist → history → lyrics → refresh rotation → logout), plus validation shape and resource-hiding |
| `PostgresIT` | Integration | Real PostgreSQL via Testcontainers: migrations apply, Hibernate `validate` passes, catalog queries and counter updates behave |

```bash
cd backend
mvn test                                                # the 24 hermetic tests

# The PostgreSQL/Testcontainers suite is named *IT (integration test), so it is deliberately not
# bound to the default lifecycle - a developer without Docker still gets a green `mvn test`.
mvn test -Dtest=PostgresIT -DfailIfNoTests=false        # requires Docker
```

The Flutter client carries its own suite (`cd frontend && flutter test` — 31 tests, with a clean
`flutter analyze`); see `frontend/README.md`.

The integration suite is what caught two real defects during development: the cold-start
recommendation path trusted the repository's page size instead of enforcing the limit itself, and
the search fallback advertised `fuzzyMatched: true` even when it had found nothing.

---

## Deployment

```bash
docker compose --profile app up -d --build
```

- **Dockerfile** — multi-stage Maven → JRE-alpine image, non-root `tuneflow` user, `curl`-based
  container healthcheck against `/actuator/health/readiness`, FFmpeg included for the media
  pipeline, `MaxRAMPercentage` tuned for containers.
- **Reverse proxy** (`deploy/nginx/tuneflow.conf`) — TLS termination, security headers,
  `client_max_body_size 110m`, strict per-IP limits on `/api/v1/auth/`, upstream keepalive.
- **Media** bypasses the gateway entirely in production: clients fetch signed CDN/object-storage
  URLs directly.
- **Scaling** — the application is stateless (JWTs, Redis cache, S3 media), so replicas scale
  horizontally behind the load balancer. Because module boundaries are service interfaces, the
  busiest module (search/streaming/notification) can be extracted into its own service without a
  rewrite — the modular monolith is a staging post, not a dead end.

---

## Scope decisions and roadmap

Deliberate deviations from the documentation, agreed up front:

| Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|
| **No Elasticsearch** | PostgreSQL `pg_trgm`/tokenized search covers the MVP's catalog size. The `SearchProvider` seam keeps the upgrade path open; the compose file has an optional `search` profile when it is needed. |
| **No admin dashboard or admin REST API** | Effort went into the listener/artist experience and the Flutter client instead. Role `ADMIN` still exists and is honoured by ownership rules. |
| **HLS transcoding off by default** | `tuneflow.media.hls-enabled` exists and is wired; progressive streaming with range requests covers MVP playback. |
| **Signed-URL streaming only** | Matches the documentation's hard requirement that audio is not proxied by the API in production. |

Known work remaining:

- Flutter client: background playback via `audio_service`, and real offline files for downloads
  (the API's `PENDING → COMPLETED` licence flow is already wired; writing bytes to disk is not).
- Backend: bulk delete for history clearing (currently row-by-row, capped), artist-cache eviction
  on profile updates, and an outbox for guaranteed at-least-once event delivery under Kafka.
- Optional: Elasticsearch provider, HLS packaging, admin reporting endpoints, offline download
  manifests for the mobile client.
